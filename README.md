# Writing-Samples

This repo contains three writing samples: "John Locke Likes This" (under review at Journal of the History of Ideas); "Seeing the King Over the Water" (forthcoming in special issue of English Studies on data visualization), and "The Proper Study of Mankind in Pope and Thomson" (forthcoming in ELH).

Please do not circulate these writing samples since none are yet officially in print.
